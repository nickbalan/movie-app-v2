# MyFlix Angular Client

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.5.

## Objective

Using Angular, build the client-side for an application called myFlix based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database), with supporting documentation.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that I can learn more about movies I’ve watched or am interested in. 
- As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.

## Initial Technical Requirements
- The application must be written in Angular (version 9 or later)  
- The application requires the latest version of Node.js and npm package  
- The application must contain user registration and login forms  
- The application must be designed using Angular Material   
- The application's codebase must contain comments using Typedoc  
- The project must contain technical documentation using JSDoc  
- The project must be hosted on GitHub Pages 

## Key Features  
- Your app should display a welcome view where users will be able to either log in or register an 
account.  
- Once authenticated, the user should now view all movies.  
- Upon clicking on a particular movie, users will be taken to a single movie view, where additional movie details will be displayed. The single movie view will contain the following additional features:   
  - A button that when clicked takes a user to the ​ director view​, where details about the director of that particular movie will be displayed. 
  - A button that when clicked takes a user to the ​ genre view​, where details about that particular genre of the movie will be displayed. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
